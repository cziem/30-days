## Big O Notation

Big O is a notation used to classify the scalability of a function or runtime. It allows us to estimate the time it takes to run thorough an operation or algorithm based on the input size.

It describes how `performant` a function or algorithm is.

Big O notations are

- constant: `O (1)` here runtime operations remains constant regardless of the input size
- linear runtime: `O (n)` here the runtime increases as `n` increases. You can say: the runtime is directly proportional to the input
- exponential runtime: `O (n^2)`
- logarithimic runtime: `O (log n)`
